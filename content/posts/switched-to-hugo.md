I switched the website from pure HTML/CSS and a few shell scripts to using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a blazing fast static site generator written in Go. This will simplify the process of working on the website.

Alongside upgrading to Hugo, I updated the appearance of the site to be easier on the eyes, featuring the color palette of the popular [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) theme.
